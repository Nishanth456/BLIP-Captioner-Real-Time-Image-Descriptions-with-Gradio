# **BLIP Captioner: Real-Time Image Descriptions with Gradio**

## **Overview**

This project leverages the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model and Gradio UI to create an interactive tool for generating descriptive captions for uploaded images. It combines advanced image captioning capabilities with a user-friendly web interface for real-time caption generation.

## **Features**

- **Interactive Interface:** Upload an image to generate a descriptive caption.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Uses the BLIP model to produce captions in real-time.
- **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive Gradio interface.

## **Prerequisites**

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Pip

### **Additional Code Files**

The repository also contains the following code files:

- **`Gradio Intro.py`**: An introductory script for understanding and using Gradio.
- **`Image Caption.py`**: An alternative implementation of the image captioning task.
- **`Image Caption - Gradio.py`**: Another variant of the image captioning project with Gradio integration.
- **`Image Classification ResNet-18 Gradio.py`**: A script demonstrating image classification using the ResNet-18 model with Gradio.
